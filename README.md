# Product Registration
A CRUD product registration app. On the server side this app uses Node and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate HTML. This app also follows the MVC design pattern and use Sequelize to interact with the database. On the client side uses Bootstrap for layout and style, and JQuery to validate user input.

## How it works
- The product registration form allows users to enter the product information and save it in the database.

- The List page allows user to see the products saved in the database, search, sort and edit or delete then.

- Each burger in the waiting area also an input to enter the name of the customer and a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
